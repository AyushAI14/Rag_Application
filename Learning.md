# What is RAG Applications?

A way to optimize LLMs so they gain experience from an organization’s internal data, beyond their training data.

---

## Why RAG?

- Extends the scope of an LLM on a specific domain  
- Cost-efficient  
- More accurate  

---

## Solutions that RAG Provides

### Problem 1
Taking a recent model **GPT-5** which was launched in August — it is trained only on data up to that date.  
If we try to ask a question related to **September**, it may start hallucinating (making things up).  

### Problem 2
Consider a startup that has **policies, finance, HR data** as confidential information and wants to build a chatbot.  

- Fine-tuning a model would be **expensive and time-consuming**  
- Data would keep **updating continuously**

## So, here comes RAG

- Accurate  
- Updates every time  
- Merges with LLM to provide better results
